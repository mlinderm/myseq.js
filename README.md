# myseq.js

myseg.js is a tool for interactive analysis of personal genomes (distributed as
compressed-and-indexed VCF files) inspired by the
[Interpretome](http://www.interpretome.com).

MySeq is composed of:
1. A Node.js and browser compatible library for querying and parsing
   [Tabix-indexed](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html) VCF files
2. A React-based client application

MySeq is ultimately intended for use as a genomics educational platform
